# Fraud Analysis: Simple Statistic
## Group by category  
Based on the results, the majority of fraud is observed in travel, leisure, and sports-related transactions.

## Group by age  
The result of the Age Group 0 is a bit different from the rest. However, Age Group 0 only has 40 cases in the entire dataset, making it not feasible to split these out into a separate group and run the model on that amount of observations.

# Fraud Analysis: Clustering 
## KMeans Clustering
  1. Run **MiniBatch** Kmeans over the number of clusters
  2. Use **Elbow method** to find the optimal number of clusters (2 clusters based on the plot)

  3. Prediction: Fit the KMeans model on existing data and define a cutoff point for fraud when new data is introduced.
    (Here, exceeding the 85th percentile of the distances to the cluster centroids is considered as potential fraud.)

  5. Perform an ROC plot to check the model accuracy

# Fraud Analysis: Text Data
## Word Search
Search for specific words that are suspicious or appeared in previous fraud cases. This techniques can be utilized in textual data such as emails, transaction descriptions, employee notes, insurance claim ,etc.

## Text Mining
  1. Import NLTK Ppackages for text preprocessing
  2. Define **stop words, punctuation, and lemmaizer**
  3. Clean textual data based on previous step

  4. Run **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** topic model
     - use **gensim**
     - This step assigns each word a unique ID and calculate its frequency in each document
  6. Decide Number of Topics and Extract Top 5 Words for Each Topic

  7. Observe if there is an unusual topic that need further investigation
